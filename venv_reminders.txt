have to leave this text file here cause I cannot for the life of me remember how
to use the python venv on WSL

python3 -m venv venv         # will create a venv
source venv/bin/activate     # will activate
deactive		     # deactivate venv 


streamlit hello         # launch a sample web app
CTRL+C              # stop the streamlit server from running on the port
